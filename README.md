# My Grocery List - Back End

## Introduction

The My Grocery List project is a custom grocery list full-stack application made with JavaScript. It allows for adding, checking off(editing) and deleting grocery items from a web browser. Checked off items are displayed below the main grocery list so they can be added back with convenience. Items are read, edited, deleted and stored long-term in a database.

## Front End (User Interface)

See [My Grocery List - Front End](https://github.com/merogers/my-grocery-app-frontend.git) for more details.

## Back End (API and Database)

[My Grocery List - Back End](https://github.com/merogers/my-grocery-app-backend.git). 

This is the API and database for the application that listens for requests from the front-end. It utilizes a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server running an [Express](https://expressjs.com/)-based RESTful API that connects to and handles requests for the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
